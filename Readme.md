# Representative Trajectories of a magneto-rotational supernova
Representative trajectories for the MR-SN model 35OC-Rs (***Obergaulinger & Aloy, MNRAS, 469, L43, 2017***) and their nucleosynthesis (***Reichert M., Obergaulinger M., Eichler M., Aloy M. A., Arcones A., MNRAS, 501, 5733, 2021***).

If you use the trajectories (tracer_x.dat) or nucleosynthesis output (finab.dat), please cite both papers:
- Obergaulinger & Aloy, MNRAS, 469, L43 (2017)
- Reichert et al., MNRAS, 501, 5733, (2021)

The trajectories are separate into different groups as described in Reichert et al. (2020). For each group, ten representative trajectories are given, which have been selected so that on average they best match the integrated pattern of all trajectories in that group. The ejected mass within of each group is given in the following table:

 Group           |  Mass [M sol]
 ----------------|----------------
 Alpha           |  0.11559
 Alpha-Fe        |  0.04133
 Fe              |  0.06586
 Fe-weak-r       |  0.11259
 Weak-r          |  0.04156
 r-process       |  0.01207
 Total           |  0.38900
