# Representative Trajectories of a magneto-rotational supernova
Trajectories that have been used in Reichert et al. (2020).

Representative trajectories for the MR-SN model 35OC-Rs. Trajectories are calculated in Obergaulinger & Aloy, MNRAS, 469, L43 (2017). If you use these data please cite ***Obergaulinger & Aloy, MNRAS, 469, L43 (2017)*** and ***Reichert et al. (2020)***.

The trajectories are splitted into different groups as described in Reichert et al. (2020). For each group, ten representative trajectories are given, which have been selected so that on average they best match the integrated pattern of all trajectories in that group. 

The files *tracer_x.dat* contain information of the time (in s), the temperature (in GK), the density (in g/cm^3), the radius (in km), the electron fraction, the electron neutrino luminosities (in erg/s), the electron antineutrino luminosity (in erg/s), the electron neutrino temperature (in MeV), and the electron antineutrino temperature (in MeV).

The files *finab.dat* contain information of the mass number, atomic number, neutron number, abundance, and mass fraction of the corresponding tracer.

The weighting of each group to the total abundances can be found in the following table:

 Group           |  Mass [M sol]
 ----------------|----------------
 Alpha           |  0.11559214
 Alpha-Fe        |  0.04132624
 Fe              |  0.06585759
 Fe-weak-r       |  0.11259239
 Weak-r          |  0.04156259
 r-process       |  0.01206904
 Total           |  0.38900000

Furthermore, each folder contains a plot with a comparison between the average pattern of the representative tracer to the integrated pattern of all tracers that belong to the group.
